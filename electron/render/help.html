        <h3>Wondering how it works?</h3>
        <hr>

        <p> This is an application of <b> Steganography</b>. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file,
            message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. Steganography is concerned both with
            concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents while cryptography is the practice
            of protecting the contents of a message alone.</p>

        <p>The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract
            attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable
            they are, arouse interest. </p>

        <h4>Process of hiding and retriving message in an image</h4>
        <p> We get an image, a keyword and a message from the user. The message is encrypted with the help of the
            user-provided keyword by using Vigenere's cipher.</p>
        <p> Certain binary data in the image is modified to represent the encrypted message. The image looks perfectly
            normal to the human eye even after embedding the message in the image.</p>

        <p> <i>The following image shows the process flow </i></p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/flow.png">

        <p> When someone wants to access the message, he/she has to provide the image and the keyword. The encrypted
            message is extracted from the image and then decrypted using the keyword.</p>
