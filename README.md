## How it works?
#### Embedding the message in an image
1. We get the following inputs from the user: an image, a keyword and a message 
1. The message is encrypted with the help of the keyword by using Vigenere's cipher
1. The encrypted text is converted to an array of numbers using ASCII encoding
1. The alpha channel data in the image is modified to represent the array of numbers and a unique end token

#### Extracting the message from an image
1. We get the following inputs from the user: an image and a keyword
1. The alpha channel content of the image is parsed until a unique end token is reached to obtain an array of numbers
1. The array of numbers is converted to encrypted text using ASCII encoding
1. The extracted text is decrypted using the keyword and then displayed to the user
